On May 21st, Showtime brought back David Lynch’s groundbreaking TV series Twin Peaks, and fulfilled a prophecy in the process. In the second season finale, back in 1991, the spirit of series-defining murder victim Laura Palmer told FBI special agent and series protagonist Dale Cooper, “I’ll see you again in 25 years.” That clip plays again in the first episode of Lynch’s Twin Peaks revival, as a reminder that decades have in fact gone by, Laura’s promise has been carried out, and a series canceled mid-story is back on the air.A lot has changed in 25 years. The original cast members, who are mostly back on board, have all aged heavily and visibly. Many of the characters have moved on in life, getting new jobs, forming families, or taking up new obsessions. But in the opening episode, Dale Cooper was still...</td>\n",

The 19-year-old Chinese prodigy declared he would never lose to an AI following AlphaGo’s earthshaking victory over Lee Se-dol last year. To see him onstage last week, nearly bent double over the Go board and fidgeting with his hair, was to see a man comprehensively put in his place.But focusing on that would miss the point.

Hammer is the mastermind behind the American reboot of House of Cards, the guy with the unlikely idea of bringing together David Fincher and a forgotten BBC series. He oversaw two of CBS Films’ first prestige movies: the Coen brothers’ Inside Llewyn Davis and Martin McDonagh’s Seven Psychopaths. He’s had a charmed career: leap-frogging from a master’s degree at Stanford to an entry-level job at Media Rights Capital to eventually becoming the president of CBS’s fledgling films division. So when Hammer came to Turner with an ambitious concept, the cable giant was willing to entertain it. Turner owns TBS, TNT, CNN, and Cartoon Network, but what Hammer was proposing was something altogether different: an all-in-one production company that would thrive online and pretty much do whatever it wanted.

These accessories — batteries, cables, chargers — would solve our most persistent gadget problem by letting us stay powered on at all times. There were just a few problems: Yang knew nothing about starting a company, building consumer electronics, or selling products. “I was a software engineer all my life at Google. I didn’t know anyone in the electronics manufacturing world,” Yang tells me over Skype from his office in Shenzhen, China. But he started the company regardless, thanks in no small part to his previous experience with Amazon’s sellers marketplace, a platform for third-party companies and tiny one- or two-person teams interested in selling directly to consumers.

But what you begin to realize after you do that long enough — you aren’t talking about anything specific. In other words, you aren’t really talking about whether some people have lighter skin or some people have blonde hair or some people have blue eyes or some people have kinky hair. You’re talking about power.” This is the voice of journalist, cultural critic, and best-selling author Ta-Nehisi Coates. Coates is the writer of Marvel’s latest entry in the Black Panther canon, Black Panther: A Nation Under Our Feet.

On May 21st, Showtime brought back David Lynch’s groundbreaking TV series Twin Peaks, and fulfilled a prophecy in the process. In the second season finale, back in 1991, the spirit of series-defining murder victim Laura Palmer told FBI special agent and series protagonist Dale Cooper, “I’ll see you again in 25 years.” That clip plays again in the first episode of Lynch’s Twin Peaks revival, as a reminder that decades have in fact gone by, Laura’s promise has been carried out, and a series canceled mid-story is back on the air.A lot has changed in 25 years. The original cast members, who are mostly back on board, have all aged heavily and visibly. Many of the characters have moved on in life, getting new jobs, forming families, or taking up new obsessions. But in the opening episode, Dale Cooper was still...\n",

If you heard about AlphaGo’s latest exploits last week — crushing the world’s best Go player and confirming that artificial intelligence had mastered the ancient Chinese board game — you may have heard the news delivered in doomsday terms.There was a certain melancholy to Ke Jie’s capitulation, to be sure. The 19-year-old Chinese prodigy declared he would never lose to an AI following AlphaGo’s earthshaking victory over Lee Se-dol last year.

              "2  The Viral Machine      Super Deluxe built a weird internet empire. Can it succeed on TV? When Wolfgang Hammer talks about the future of entertainment, people listen. Hammer is the mastermind behind the American reboot of House of Cards, the guy with the unlikely idea of bringing together David Fincher and a forgotten BBC series. He oversaw two of CBS Films’ first prestige movies: the Coen brothers’ Inside Llewyn Davis and Martin McDonagh’s Seven Psychopaths. He’s had a charmed career: leap-frogging from a master’s degree at Stanford to an entry-level job at Media Rights Capital to eventually becoming the president of CBS’s fledgling films division. So when Hammer came to Turner with an ambitious concept, the cable giant was willing to entertain it. Turner owns TBS, TNT, CNN, and Cartoon Network, but what Hammer was proposing was something altogether different: an all-in-one production company that would thrive online and pretty much do whatever it wanted.

              "3  How Anker is beating Apple and Samsung at their own accessory game      Steven Yang quit his job at Google in the summer of 2011 to build the products he felt the world needed: a line of reasonably priced accessories that would be better than the ones you could buy from Apple and other big-name brands. These accessories — batteries, cables, chargers — would solve our most persistent gadget problem by letting us stay powered on at all times. There were just a few problems: Yang knew nothing about starting a company, building consumer electronics, or selling products. “I was a software engineer all my life at Google. I didn’t know anyone in the electronics manufacturing world,” Yang tells me over Skype from his office in Shenzhen, China. But he started the company regardless, thanks in no small part to his previous experience with Amazon’s sellers marketplace, a platform for third-party companies and tiny one- or two-person teams interested in selling directly to consumers. He named the company Anker, after...\n",

But we will have access to the best stories, and we will get our fair share of works from the best writers. We definitely will not talk \"adult\" or \"juvenile\" relative to our content as we feel such terms are misleading. We would rather think at all times in the terms of \"story\". Some of the greatest escapist literature ever written, Treasure Island for instance, could be put into either category or both.

We have tried to make IF different from any other science fiction magazine on the stands while still building it along the lines of what every science fiction mag must be. Aside from the letter columns and the editorial, which are departments of field-wide use, we have not copied any feature of any other magazine. We will not, for instance, review fanzines, because we feel that is being most ably done by other mags.

We cannot, in honesty, say we will publish at all times the best science fiction in the field. That would not be true. But we will have access to the best stories, and we will get our fair share of works from the best writers. We definitely will not talk \"adult\" or \"juvenile\" relative to our content as we feel such terms are misleading. We would rather think at all times in the terms of \"story\". Some of the greatest escapist literature ever written, Treasure Island for instance, could be put into either category or both. And if Edgar Rice Burroughs is juvenile, then so are we, because the late master has given us some memorable thrills. Frankly, we don't think you'll buy IF because you feel we print better yams than any other mag.\n",

We have tried to make IF different from any other science fiction magazine on the stands while still building it along the lines of what every science fiction mag must be. Aside from the letter columns and the editorial, which are departments of field-wide use, we have not copied any feature of any other magazine. We will not, for instance, review fanzines, because we feel that is being most ably done by other mags.

Remember the old creed we live by. A writer may cheat on his wife, but he is ever true to the story-line. He may haul his infant son around by one leg. but he carries a good story-idea like a holy relic. If there is only one logical ending for Twelve Times ZerG, that's the ending we want.\" Therefore, we do not feel the majority of readers necessarily want a happy ending regardless of all else.
